# Ephemeral

Ephemeral is a mock website that creates a visual diagram of credit card expenses, breaking down expenses into groups and color-coordinating them for easier visualization. Since this website is not connected to any endpoints, users will manually create charges internally. 

This project was a valuable learning experience, allowing me to enhance my technical skills and understanding of web-base development as a whole.

## Features

- Organizes credit card expenses into meaningful groups
- Visualizes expenses using color-coordinated diagram
- User-friendly interface for adding and editing expenses

## Requirements

- A web browser with support for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RyanMcGrath1/Ephemeral.git
```

2. Open the `Ephemeral/WebServices/index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Upon visiting the website, you will be prompted to enter your credit card expenses. The expenses will be organized into groups and visualized using a color-coordinated diagram. You can edit and add expenses as needed.
